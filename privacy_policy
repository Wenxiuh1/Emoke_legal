# emoke Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 1, 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to emoke. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use the emoke mobile application.

emoke is a personal journaling app designed to help you track and reflect on your emotions. We believe that your emotional journey is deeply personal, and we've built emoke with privacy at its core.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

When you use emoke, you create journal entries that may include:

- **Emotion selections**: The emotions you choose to record
- **Written reflections**: Any text you write in your journal entries
- **Timestamps**: When you create each entry
- **Session data**: Information about your journaling sessions

### Information Collected Automatically

emoke may automatically collect:

- **Device information**: Device type, operating system version
- **Usage data**: How you interact with the app's features
- **Crash reports**: Technical data to help us fix bugs and improve performance

This information is processed only on your device as part of the app's normal operation and is not transmitted to us or to any remote server.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Provide the core service**: Enable you to create, view, and manage your emotional journal
- **Improve the app**: Analyze usage patterns to enhance features and user experience
- **Fix technical issues**: Diagnose and resolve bugs or performance problems
- **Communicate with you**: Respond to your support requests and feedback

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

**Your journal entries are stored locally on your device.** We do not upload your emotional reflections, journal text, or personal entries to any remote server. Your data stays on your device, under your control.

### Security Measures

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information:

- Data is stored as normal app data on your device and relies on your device's own security features (such as device lock and operating system protections)
- We do not transmit your journal content over the internet
- We do not share your emotional data with third parties

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.

Because your journal content is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers, we generally do not share it with anyone.

We may disclose limited information only if required by law or to protect our legal rights (for example, information you voluntarily provide when contacting us by email).

## Your Rights and Choices

You have the following rights regarding your data:

- **Access**: You can view all your journal entries within the app
- **Deletion**: You can delete individual entries or all your data at any time
- **Export**: You can request a copy of your data (feature coming soon)

## Children's Privacy

emoke is not intended for children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 18, please contact us immediately.

## Third-Party Services

emoke does not currently use third-party analytics, advertising, or crash reporting services that receive your journal content.

If this changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy to describe what services are used and for what purpose, and we will comply with any applicable consent requirements.

## Data Retention

Your journal data is retained on your device until you choose to delete it. If you uninstall the app, all local data will be removed from your device.

## International Data Transfers

Since your data is stored locally on your device, there are no international data transfers of your journal content.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by:

- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the app
- Updating the "Last Updated" date
- Sending you a notification (if you've provided contact information)

Your continued use of emoke after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
